Identified in this photograph are 3750 Corporal (Cpl) Robert Chaffey Stuart (third from left) and 3489 Private (Pte) John Charles Bitton (fourth from left). Stuart, a labourer from Naracoorte SA, embarked with the 12th Battalion in December 1915, was transferred to the 52nd Battalion in March 1916, and then to the 13th Light Trench Mortar Battery in July of the same year. In January 1919 he was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal. Bitton, a labourer from Maylands WA, embarked with the 28th Battalion in January 1916, was transferred to the 51st Battalion in March of the same year and then to the 13th Light Trench Mortar Battery in July. In March 1919 he was Mentioned in Despatches for his service. Both men returned to Australia in May 1919. The soldiers in this photograph each posed for their own individual portraits. In these portraits they are each wearing the same helmet, suggesting it was a prop owned by the photographers.

From left to right: 3981 Private (Pte) William Pinkerton; 3980 Lance Corporal Horace Arnold Parton; 3976 Lance Corporal Ernest Gladstone Cubbins. Pinkerton, a grocer from Prahran, Victoria, and Cubbins, a salesman from Kew, Victoria were both awarded the Military Medal for their bravery while repairing communication lines during the Third Battle of Ypres in September 1917. Pte Pinkerton sustained a shrapnel wound to his right knee in August 1918, and after convalescing returned to Australia in May 1919. Horace Parton was an accountant from Richmond, Victoria, and with Cubbins and other members of their unit sustained injuries from gas in August 1918. Both also returned to Australia in May 1919. (See also P10550.689).\nHorace Parton enlisted in the Second World War and served as a Warrant Officer with RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne. He was hospitalized with illness possibly relating to the gas injuries from his earlier service, and he died in December 1943 at the age of 52.\nFrom the Thuillier collection of glass plate negatives.
